# Alternate sort 

1. Design and implement a library/package to alternate sort the given array. 

Examples:

| Input | Output|
|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| `1, 7, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`    | `7, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4`    |
| `2, -99, 7, 3, 5, 6`     | `7, -99, 6, 2, 5, 3`     |
| `8, 8, 3, 1, -7, -7`     | `8, -7, 8, -7, 3, 1`     |
| `5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5`    | `5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5`    |
|                          |                          |

2. How can we be reasonably sure about the correctness of the solution?
3. Discuss the space-time complexity of the proposed solution (both in general and language related)
4. Is there any pathological input or possible corner case to be taken into account?
5. Provide this solution as a service a user can call via HTTP (preferred deployment method is  docker but alternatives are welcome if justified)
