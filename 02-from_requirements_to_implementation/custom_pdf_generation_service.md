# Custom PDF generation service

1. Design a system to satisfy the following 
    * a user requests the generation of a new PDF file calling an HTTPs endpoint (with authentication, authorization is optional)
    * the user should be able to provide some data (e.g. the customer name) to customize the PDF
    * the PDF is generated containing the user-provided data
    * the PDF is stored somewhere
    * the user is notified about the generated PDF
    * the user can retrieve the generated PDF
    * what if the service fail somewhere?
2. Evaluate the time needed to implement the solution
3. Discuss trade-offs of the system designed (speed, cost, user experience, dev effort, security)  
4. Discuss system deployment and update strategy (how, where, why, trade-offs â€¦)
5. Discuss system monitoring, health evaluation, log management
