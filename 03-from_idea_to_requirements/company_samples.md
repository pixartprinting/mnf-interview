# Company samples

We have to provide an application for a new production department. 
The new department is dedicated to the assembly of samples which will be sent, freely, to our customers.

Those samples are composed by:
* pieces we get from external suppliers
* custom printed internal materials
* standard company printed products

There are different kinds of samples and some samples are custom made (composition is non-standard).

What do you think this application needs to do? What do the stakeholders really want? What would you propose?

---

Now assume the production operator need to:
* be able to order, both internally and externally, out-of-stock parts
* know 
  * how many pieces are available for each sample part type
  * when the ordered pieces are available for pick-up and where (production department or outsourcer warehouse)
  * how many samples are ready for shipment
  * how many have been ordered  
  * how many are in which phase of assembly
  * given a sample, what is the next assembly phase

1. Explain the requirements to your colleagues
2. Provide a solution to efficiently provide the requested application
3. How will you plan the development?
4. Discuss assumptions, doubts, missing information and trade-offs about the problem and your solution
5. Is there any time left? You can propose an implementation! :)
