# Production planning 

We have to implement a new workflow for a product. 
The product, for simplicity, is one-page and all the orders arrive at the same time. 
Customer orders can vary buy allowed production duration (defined by the number of days to the latest possible carrier pickup-date) and number of copies.
On a printable sheet there is space for 4 instances of this product. 

1. Explain the requirements to your colleagues
2. Provide a solution to efficiently arrange the printing
3. Discuss assumptions, doubts, missing information and trade-offs about the problem and your solution

    Order examples:
    * 3 copies, 2 days
    * 1 copy, 3 days
    * 3 copies, 3 days
    * 7 copies, 1 day
    * 1 copy, 4 days
    * â€¦

4. Is there any time left? You can propose an implementation! :)
