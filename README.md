# Intro
 
Hi,
thank you for your interest in Pixartprinting and thank you for your effort in this step of the interview process.
 
This task is made of multiple steps, please complete them in the order they are presented. Feel free to ask any question you need, and/or take reasonable assumptions.
Please document and motivate any assumption you take.
Don't panic if you are not able to complete all the steps. :)
 
The deliverable we are expecting is a link to a repository (if possible, on GitHub) containing:
 
* Your code
* One or multiple Dockerfile (if multiple, please include a docker compose file) to test and run the code. We should be able to deal with your application without installing anything but docker in our system.
* A README.md file, containing a description of the code, documentation, assumptions you took. In general, anything you think would help us understanding and running your work.
