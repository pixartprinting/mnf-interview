# Tech interview
 
The interview is organized in 4 different, ascending, steps. 

1. Given some "legacy" code the candidate has inherited, discuss, propose and motivate possible refactor and improvement actions ([Refactor](./00-refactor/README.md))
2. The candidate is asked to implement a small, simple, non-trivial function to solve a well-defined problem (extensive examples of desired input and output are provided) ([Small code](./01-small_code/README.md))
3. Given detailed requirements the candidate is asked to discuss a possible implementation ([From requirements to implementation](./02-from_requirements_to_implementation)) 
4. Given a general idea the candidate is asked to discuss possible architectures and to provide a list of requirements ([From idea to requirements](./03-from_idea_to_requirements)) 

The idea is not to trick the candidate but to open a conversation about technical background, solutions, ...
The steps are language-independent.
The steps are based (with very few exceptions) on the daily work we deal with everyday here in Pixart.
